# Firebase To-Do App

This is a complete, production-ready To-Do List Application that uses Google Firebase (Firestore + Authentication) for its backend.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, and logout with email and password.
- **Cloud Database**: Tasks are stored and retrieved from Firebase Firestore.
- **Realtime Updates**: The task list updates in real-time across all devices thanks to Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their own tasks.
- **Protected Routes**: Only authenticated users can access the main dashboard.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Secure by Design**: Firestore security rules ensure that users can only access their own data.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Notifications**: React Hot Toast
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication & Firestore)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Google Firebase account

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd firebase-todo-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**

    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    - In your project, go to the **Authentication** section and enable the **Email/Password** sign-in method.
    - Go to the **Firestore Database** section and create a new database. Start in **test mode** for now. You can apply the security rules later.
    - In your project settings, find your web app's configuration object. It will look something like this:

      ```javascript
      const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "AIzaSy...",
        authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
        projectId: "your-project-id",
        storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "...",
        appId: "1:..."
      };
      ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**

    - Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    - Copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env`.
    - Fill in the values for each variable using the Firebase config object from the previous step.

    ```
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Deploying Firestore Rules

To secure your database, you need to deploy the provided security rules.

1.  **Install the Firebase CLI:**

    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

2.  **Login to Firebase:**

    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```

3.  **Initialize Firebase in your project (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    firebase init
    ```

    - Select **Firestore**.
    - Choose the Firebase project you created.
    - Keep the default file names.

4.  **Deploy the rules:**

    - Copy the contents of the `firestore.rules` file in this repository into the `firestore.rules` file generated by the CLI.
    - Run the following command:

      ```bash
      firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
      ```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.

## Known Limitations

- **No server-side rendering**: This is a client-side rendered application.
- **Limited error handling**: Error handling is basic and could be improved with more specific messages.
- **No tests**: This project does not include a testing suite.
