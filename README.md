# Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to deepen my expertise in **TypeScript** and **Node.js** by building practical, modular applications that enhance my understanding of type-safe programming and command-line interfaces. This project is a step toward mastering TypeScript’s type system, dynamic module loading, and real-time user interaction in a CLI environment.

This software is a command-line chatbot built with **TypeScript** and **Node.js**. It allows users to interact via text input in a terminal, where the chatbot matches inputs against a set of predefined regex-based rules and responds accordingly. The application features a modular rule system, enabling easy extension by adding new rule files, and includes unit tests to ensure reliability.

My purpose for creating this software was to explore TypeScript’s capabilities for building robust, maintainable CLI applications. I focused on creating a flexible rule engine, leveraging TypeScript’s type safety to catch errors early, and implementing a clean, extensible architecture to practice modern software engineering principles.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the following tools:

*   **Visual Studio Code**: A lightweight code editor with excellent TypeScript support and debugging capabilities.
*   **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing the TypeScript-compiled JavaScript code.
*   **TypeScript Compiler (tsc)**: Used to compile TypeScript code to JavaScript.
*   **Jest**: A testing framework for writing and running unit tests to verify rule-matching logic.
*   **npm**: The package manager for installing dependencies and managing scripts.
*   **Git**: Version control system for tracking code changes and hosting the project on GitHub.

The programming language used is **TypeScript**, a superset of JavaScript that adds static types for enhanced code reliability and maintainability. TypeScript was chosen for its strong typing, which helps catch errors at compile time, and its robust support for Node.js development.
